The city is known for its magnificent Duomo, one of the largest Gothic cathedrals in the world, which dominates the city center. A stroll through the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, a stunning 19th-century shopping arcade, is a must-do, as is a visit to the iconic Sforza Castle, home to several museums and art collections. The Pinacoteca di Brera, located in the historic Brera district, is a top destination for art lovers, with an impressive collection of Italian Renaissance art. Parco Sempione, a large park in the heart of Milan, is a great place to relax and enjoy a picnic. For budget foodies, a trip to the Navigli district is a must-do, with its lively bars, cafes, and restaurants. And, of course, no visit to Milan is complete without indulging in some gelato, preferably from one of the city's best gelaterias such as Gelateria della Musica or Gelateria Marghera. With its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant culture, Milan is a city not to be missed by travelers."
